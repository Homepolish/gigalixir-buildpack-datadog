### Pull requests

Have you fixed a bug or written a new check and want to share it? Many thanks!

Here are some tips to keep in mind when submitting a PR:

* Keep it small and focused. Avoid changing too many things at once.
* Summarize your PR with an explanatory title and a message describing your changes. Cross-reference any related bugs/PRs and provide steps for testing when appropriate.
* Write meaningful commit messages. The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you've been working on for a day.
* Rebase your changes on `master` and **squash** your commits whenever possibleâ€”it keeps the history clean, and it's easier to revert later if necessary.
